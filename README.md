# Charged

We needed to create a game in a month since the other game we were working out gained complications due to external forces. I had this idea for a game in the back of my mind for a while now: pushing and pulling a particle from one end to another through points you placed. I learned how to communicate my own vision and to use multiple mediums in order to get it across. Some people preferred me drawing out how I wanted some features to work while others preferred a bullet point of features that it needed to accomplish. It was also neat to see the progression between an idea in your head to see it all come together in the end.

Made in Unity.
